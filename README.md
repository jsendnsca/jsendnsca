# Overview

JSend NSCA is Java API for sending passive checks to the [Nagios NSCA add-on](https://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Addons/Passive-Checks/NSCA--2D-Nagios-Service-Check-Acceptor/details).

By using JSend NSCA, you can easily integrate your Java applications into a Nagios monitored environment thereby notifying [Nagios](https://www.nagios.org)/[Icinga](https://www.icinga.org/)/[Opsview](https://www.opsview.com/) of problems and issues during the running of your application.

          .withMessage("should work if everything set up OK")
          .create();
  
      NagiosPassiveCheckSender sender = new NagiosPassiveCheckSender(settings);
  
      try {
          sender.send(payload);
      } catch (NagiosException e) {

# Background

JSend NSCA was developed as a company I worked for used Nagios to monitor applications and servers. For existing applications written in Perl and c, there are options available to send passive checks but for Java applications, the option available was to shell out and execute the send_nsca command line tool.

Although send_nsca worked in this manner, itâ€™s ugly and we preferred having the code within our applications for better performance, testability, cleanliness...

A search on the internet revealed a few options such as the [NagiosAppender](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nagiosappender/) for log4j but in the end we settled on writing our own client. This client is currently in use thus proving the feasibility of the approach.

On the back of this, I decided to write JSend NSCA from the ground up as an exercise in TDD and thought I would make it available as an open source project so other developers can benefit from the functionality.
